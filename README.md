## Description
This porfolio is built by the modern approach - react.js instead of traditional HTML and JS. By building user interfaces and UI components, the developer is able to work each section individually without interfering other sections. I attempted to repulciate my previous HTML profolilo; each section was divided into several UI components and connected by react.js.
